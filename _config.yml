          Objective: Deploy an application on a secure, easy to manage, and cost-effective AWS cloud platform.
        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
          * The goal of this project was to familiarize ourselves with cloud offerings and gain cloud fluency to create automated, secure,
          and cost-effective web applications that will be hosted on AWS cloud or other hosting platforms. more specifically, 
          we launched a webserver to host my online identity and also deployed a WordPress-based website which is a website builder to create blogs and share information about tech with others.
          To accomplish this, we utilized a variety of AWS services and tools. 
          * Gained a basic understanding of the IT services available on AWS and their use cases. We researched AWS services such as <mark>EC2, S3, RDS, Route53
          and IAM</mark> while setting up a <mark>budget and billing alarms</mark> to be notified and act accordingly. 
          * Utilized essential tools for handling files, directories, and services. Among these services such as <mark> SSH, DHCP, DNS, HTTP, FTP, NFS, NTP, Cron, and Loggings </mark>. 
          * Familiarized me with the command-line environment and shell scripts to configure the infrastructure.
          * Created and configured file systems, and followed best practices and conventions according to AWS Documentation. created partitions and logical volumes, and configured user accounts and groups.
          * Deployed, configured, and maintained systems, including regular software updates and installation, and regular backing up data to increase reliability and fault tolerance. 
          * Setting up security measures such as <mark>Firewalls, IP Tables, and forward and backward proxy configurations</mark>.

          Solving one of the most pressing problems in the field Bearing Faults Diagnosis using variety of Convolutional neural networks (CNN).
        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
          <mark>Bearing Fault Diagnosis</mark> is the process of detecting and diagnosing faults in bearings, which are critical components of many rotating element machineries.
          in this research field, it is important to accurately diagnose bearing faults in order to prevent further damage and costly repairs. 
          Traditionally, bearing fault diagnosis has been done using <mark>signal processing techniques</mark>, such as <mark>wavelet analysis</mark> and <mark>time-frequency analysis</mark>. However,
          these methods are limited in their ability to accurately detect and diagnose faults. <mark>Branch CNNs</mark> along with many other <mark>CNNs architectures</mark> offer a more accurate and efficient approach to bearing fault diagnosis. 
          In this approach, a CNN model is trained to identify patterns in the vibration data from a bearing. The CNN model can then be used to detect and diagnose faults in the bearing. 
          This approach has been shown to offer improved accuracy and efficiency compared to traditional signal processing techniques.
          During my graduate research, I successfully reproduced the results of published papers and helped my lab mates in building more robust CNNs to detect bearings faults.

          Published A Capsule-Type Device for Soft Tissue Cutting Using a Threadless Ball-screw Actuator as 3rd Author.
        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
          <mark>Published A Capsule-Type Device for Soft Tissue Cutting Using a Threadless Ball-screw Actuator as 3rd Author</mark>. in order to showcase my work I need to explain the purpose behind building such a tool and how we can benefit from it.
          A Capsule-type device for soft tissue cutting using a threadless ballscrew actuator is a device with the potential to revolutionize the way surgeons perform soft tissue cutting during surgery. 
          This device is a compact and lightweight motorized tool, which utilizes a ballscrew actuator to provide precise control of the cutting blade. 
          The device is designed to be inserted into the patient’s body and used to cut through soft tissue with minimal invasiveness and less trauma to the patient.
          The device consists of a precision-machined outer casing that houses the ball screw, a motor, and a cutting blade. 
          The ball screw is responsible for converting the rotational motion of the motor into linear motion, enabling the cutting blade to move in a straight line. 
          This makes it possible to achieve a more precise cut than with a manual blade. The motor is also designed to be adjustable, 
          allowing the user to adjust the speed of the cutting process depending on the type of tissue being cut. The device is highly beneficial for surgeons as it can reduce operative time, reduce the amount of tissue trauma, and improve the accuracy of the cutting process.

          <mark>Activities and societies:</mark> developed a Locomotive endoscopy biopsy capsule (LEBC) which's a type of endoscopy procedure used to diagnose and treat gastrointestinal diseases and disorders.

          <mark>Fundamentals of Manufacturing Engineering</mark>  <mark>Mechanics of Materials</mark>  <mark>Hydrodynamics and hydraulic transmission</mark>. 
          <mark>Thesis project:</mark> developed a Locomotive endoscopy biopsy capsule (LEBC). to illustrate the use cases of such medical device, the device is part of a procedure involves the insertion of a capsule-like device into the patient's gastrointestinal tract. The capsule contains a tiny camera and other small instruments that collect tissue samples for laboratory analysis. The LEBC procedure is typically performed in an outpatient setting.
          First, the patient is given a sedative to help them relax and remain comfortable during the procedure. Next, the capsule is inserted through the patient's mouth and swallowed. 
          The capsule is propelled through the gastrointestinal tract by the patient's natural peristalsis and takes about 8 to 10 hours to pass through. 
          Once the capsule reaches the desired area of the gastrointestinal tract, the camera takes pictures of the area and the instruments inside the capsule collect tissue samples. 
          The camera also transmits the images to a computer where they can be viewed by the doctor. After the procedure, the capsule is passed naturally in the patient's stool. 
          The advantage of this procedure is that it enables the doctor to diagnose and treat diseases and disorders without the need for invasive surgery. 
          Additionally, the procedure is safe and has minimal risks. The potential risks include nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain.
