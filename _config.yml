          Solving one of the most pressing problems in the field Bearing Faults Diagnosis using variety of Convolutional neural networks (CNN).
        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
          Bearing fault diagnosis is the process of detecting and diagnosing faults in bearings, which are critical components of many rotating element machinary.
          in this research field, it is important to accurately diagnose bearing faults in order to prevent further damage and costly repairs. 
          Traditionally, bearing fault diagnosis has been done using signal processing techniques, such as wavelet analysis and time-frequency analysis. However,
          these methods are limited in their ability to accurately detect and diagnose faults. Branch CNNs along with many other CNNs architectures offer a more accurate and efficient approach to bearing fault diagnosis. 
          In this approach, a CNN is trained to identify patterns in the vibration data from a bearing. The CNN can then be used to detect and diagnose faults in the bearing. 
          This approach has been shown to offer improved accuracy and efficiency compared to traditional signal processing techniques.
          During my graduate research i've successfully reproduced results of published papers and helped my lab mates in building a more robust CNNs to detect bearings faults.

          Published A Capsule-Type Device for Soft Tissue Cutting Using a Threadless Ball-screw Actuator as 3rd Author.
        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
          The use of a capsule-type device for soft tissue cutting using a threadless ball-screw actuator is an innovative step forward in the field of medical technology. This device provides an efficient, precise and safe method of cutting soft tissue in (GI) gastrointestinal, such as fat, muscle, or cancerous and connective tissue. The device consists of a capsule with a built-in motor-driven actuator and a cutting blade. The cutting blade is actuated by a ball-screw, which is threadless and self-contained within the capsule. This is a significant advancement over traditional methods of cutting soft tissue, which can be more time consuming and potentially hazardous.
          The capsule-type device is highly versatile and can be used for a variety of medical procedures, including biopsies, liposuction, and even tissue removal. Its precision and efficiency make it an attractive option for surgeons and medical professionals. Furthermore, the device is relatively easy to use and requires minimal setup and training.
          Overall, the use of a capsule-type device for soft tissue cutting using a threadless ball-screw actuator is a major advancement in the field of medical technology. It offers a precise, safe and efficient way to cut soft tissue, making it an attractive option for a variety of
