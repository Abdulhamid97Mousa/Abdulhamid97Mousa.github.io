Personal homepage (curriculum vitae or resume) based on [Jo√£o's](https://github.com/joaomoreno/resume).
Vitae is built with [skeleton](http://getskeleton.com/), powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and freely
hosted in [Github pages](https://pages.github.com/).

### Deployment

There are several alternatives to building and deploying the site:

1. build the site with [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) which pushes 
the resulting files (the contents of `_site/` or `../vitae-pages/`) 
to the *gh-pages* branch. This is the approach that is currently used. See 
[jekyll_build.yml](.github/workflows/jekyll_build.yml) for more details.

2. generate the site locally (more details below) and push the resulting
HTML to a Github repository, that GitHub Pages then host;

3. build the site with [travis-ci](https://travis-ci.org/) (with goodies from
[jekyll-travis](https://github.com/mfenner/jekyll-travis)) automatically pushing the
generated HTML files to a *gh-pages* branch.

4. deploy the static website with Jekyll-compatible hosters, such as https://www.netlify.com/, that allow for deployment from the Github repo and publish the website using CDNs. Netlify has a free starter offer.

For option **2)** simply clone this repository (*master branch*), and then run
`bundle exec jekyll serve` inside the directory. Upload the resulting `_site/` (or `../vitae-pages/`)
contents to your repository (*master branch* if uploading as your personal page
(e.g. username.github.io) or *gh-pages branch* if uploading as a project page
(as for the [demo](https://github.com/jekyllt/vitae/tree/gh-pages)).

For option **3)** you will need to set up travis-ci for your personal fork. Briefly all you
need then is to change your details in *[\_config.yml](_config.yml)* so that you can push
to your github repo. You will also need to generate a secure key to add to your
*[.travis.yml](.travis.yml)* (you can find more info on how to do it in that file).
Also make sure you read the documentation from
[jekyll-travis](https://github.com/mfenner/jekyll-travis). This approach has clear
advantages in that you simply push your file changes to GitHub and all the HTML files
are generated for you and pushed to *gh-pages*. Also you get to know if everything is
still fine with your site builds. Don't hesitate to contact me if you still have any
issues (see below about issue tracking).
