# RHCSA_EX200_ExamPrep
- I've created this repo solely to help those who are studying for RHCSA EX200 or Linux Foundation System Administration pass thier respective exams.
- This repository covers all exam objectives that you need to study to pass RHCSA EX200, the content provided are, Study Materials, Lab Guides, and frequently asked question regarding the exam.
- I've decided to publish this repo regardless of what others may say, this repository is not part of Redhat official trainings or associated with Redhat company in any shape or form, this repository sole purpose is to educate people about linux OS and help people learn linux OS, providing them a reliable learning source, free of cost, and lab questions that may help them understand linux better and prepair them for RHCSA EX200 exam or Linux Foundation system administration exam both alike, this repo is built for the collective good and from my personal passion to linux. therefore, i've decided to contribute in building something beneficial to those who can't afford Linux trainings.

# How to get the most out of this Repo
- Each main section of the exam corresponds to a Directory, for instance, if you wish to learn about "-3._Operate_Running_Systems_" section from the exam objectives, all you have to is to append the directory name to your http header.
- For example: say that you want to learn "about Operate Running Systems". then, your http header should be https://www.abdulhamid97mousa.tk/RHCSA-EX200-ExamPrep/-3._Operate_Running_Systems
